    "A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook combines two components:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **A web application:** a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, code, and their rich media output.\n",
    " - **Notebook documents:** a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the code, explanatory text, images, and rich media representations of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses include:\n",
    " - Data cleaning and transformation\n",
    " - Statistical modeling\n",
    " - Data visualization\n",
    " - Machine learning\n",
    " - Security ingvestigations!\n",
